# sudoku

To test the game after cloning, just type

```bash
cd sudoku
make
make run

```

A blank sudoku grid will open. A special file is required to load a sudoku grid. Unfortunately, I don't have one. 
If you enter values manually the solver should work 80% of the time, but only if it's a solvable sudoku.
